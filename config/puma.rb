# # This configuration file will be evaluated by Puma. The top-level methods that
# # are invoked here are part of Puma's configuration DSL. For more information
# # about methods provided by the DSL, see https://puma.io/puma/Puma/DSL.html.
# #
# # Puma starts a configurable number of processes (workers) and each process
# # serves each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
# #
# # You can control the number of workers using ENV["WEB_CONCURRENCY"]. You
# # should only set this value when you want to run 2 or more workers. The
# # default is already 1.
# #
# # The ideal number of threads per worker depends both on how much time the
# # application spends waiting for IO operations and on how much you wish to
# # prioritize throughput over latency.
# #
# # As a rule of thumb, increasing the number of threads will increase how much
# # traffic a given process can handle (throughput), but due to CRuby's
# # Global VM Lock (GVL) it has diminishing returns and will degrade the
# # response time (latency) of the application.
# #
# # The default is set to 3 threads as it's deemed a decent compromise between
# # throughput and latency for the average Rails application.
# #
# # Any libraries that use a connection pool or another resource pool should
# # be configured to provide at least as many connections as the number of
# # threads. This includes Active Record's `pool` parameter in `database.yml`.
